# Flipbook JS
This is a fork of the original [Flipbook JS](https://github.com/achigo16/flipbook-js) with some fixes and usability improvements.
The original Flipbook JS is a Javascript library, using [PDF.JS](https://github.com/mozilla/pdf.js) & [Turn.JS](https://github.com/blasten/turn.js) together to render a PDF as a
booklet, with turnable pages, and was an update of [pdfjs-flipbook](https://github.com/iberan/pdfjs-flipbook).

## Installation & Usage
1. Upload the flipbook-js code onto your server.
2. Open the page in your browser, passing a hosted filepath http://example.com/flipbook-js/web/viewer.html?file=pdf.pdf
3. Start flipping!

## Contributing
